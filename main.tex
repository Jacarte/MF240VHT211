\section{What are your skills and strengths?}
%The mini-projects will require a combination of skills, so use your strenghts for your team!

\section{General work guidelines}

The team will maintain a GitHub repository XXXX where all the progress and work will be saved. To maintain a GitHub repository for the course assignments will allow us to track our progress, to maintain a tight communication and to easily share our results. 

\subsection{How do you want to communicate?}

The team will maintain mostly an asynchronous communication having the GitHub Issue Tracker as the main channel. Besides, email communication would be used as a secondary channel. For live meetings we use Zoom, with the permanent link XXXX.

\subsection{How will you keep track of open tasks?}

In general, the tasks will be managed using the GitHub Issue Tracker. The tasks should be labelled with semantic short names, for example, for open tasks, the label "open" should be used. Notice that a task could have more than one label. 

Every issue should have an assignee, which in this case will be the leader of the task. The tasks/issues should be closed after they are finished. Each task should have a general description. Discussion on the task should be reflected as comments inside the issue. The last comment of the issue should be a link to the report or repository folder containing the deliverable.


\subsection{How do you plan the work?}

Every task should follow the next steps from its creation to its successful assessment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a new issue in the repo Issue Tracker. The title of the task should be the same name that the Canvas assignment has.
    \item The description of the tasks should have first the link to the assignment in the Canvas. Next the full description of the task should be added (if it is too large, a summary should be added).
    \item An assignee is added to the issue. The assignee will be the leader of the task.
    \item The issue is labeled as "open".
    \item Every new important change in the task, such as new added assets, should be reflected in a comment inside the issue. 
    \item The issue is completely open for team discussion.
    \item When the task is finished, the last comment should be a link to the deliverable.
    \item The issue is closed.
\end{enumerate}

% 0 - Register the assignment goals in the tracking system
% 1- Write the assignment goals as the document/repo_README outline
    % 1.2- Update this created documentation every time a tracked issue is assesed
% 2 - The final report should be based on the updated documentation.
    

\subsection{How will you create the presentations/reports?}

There is a total freedom to use whatever technology to create presentations and reports. However, every created asset should be saved as a file in the repository as well.


\subsection{Are you going to assign a leader for each assignment, who will coordinate and manage the tasks?}

The assignment of the leader (issue assignee) will be managed based on the most needed skills for the task.

1. For the first part of the seminar day:

(Possibly together with others) Study the framework given to you, and put together a 25-minute presentation, emphasising:
- What is the history of the framework (who put it together and why)?
  - TODO: Go from 20 to 20 years in the history, each period corresponds to a team member
    - [1901-1925) (assignee)
    - [1925-1949) (assignee)
    - [1949-1973) (assignee)
    - [1973-1997) (assignee)
    - [1997-)     (assignee) 
- How does the framework relate to the 4+1 principles of assurance?
  - Framework for 4+1
   - Requirement to be defined
   - Decomposition of higher level requirements into lower level requirements
   - Requirements should be satisfied
   - Controll the undesireable consequences- How important it is to meet
   - How srtingent it is to meet them 
- Is it implicit or explicit?
- What are its special characteristics in comparison to other frameworks?

You hand in the presentation here in a PPTx format, with what you aim to say during the presentation in the notes to each slide.
